<p> My snake is made up of 3-7 random cubes. The green cubes are sensors and the blue cubes are links. The joints are connected after every link so that the snake is connected. The cubes are made up of a random height, width, and length and they are connected randomly.  </p>

<p> This project is based off of https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/installation/ , where I did steps A to O. </p>
